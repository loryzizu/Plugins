E-SparqlEndpoint

### Documentation

* see [Plugin Documentation](./doc/About.md)
* see [Plugin Documentation](./doc/About_sk.md) (in Slovak)

### Technical notes

* May be used instead of e-RdfFromSparql and also replaces DPU with the same name from Charles university.
* It requires certain libraries to be provided, see "provided" dependencies in pom.xml of this DPU. Such libraries are automatically provided in 2.1.4+ release of UnifiedViews (by [lib-core module](https://github.com/UnifiedViews/Core/tree/master/lib/lib-core)) -- after installation of UnifiedViews such libraries are placed to {Core}/target/lib. This is something which should be improved in the future, so that everything is bundled in this DPU. 

### Version history

* see [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)
